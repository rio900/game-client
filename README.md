### 🕹️ Running the Unity Client

This repository contains the **Unity game client** for DotStriker. To ensure proper functionality, make sure the **Polkadot node is already running** before launching the game.  
👉 Node setup instructions are available here: [https://github.com/rio900/on-chain-game](https://github.com/rio900/on-chain-game)

#### 🛠️ Launching the Game

Once the node is running:

1. Open the Unity project and press the **Play** button in the editor.
2. By default, the client will connect to the node using the **Alice** account.
3. To test with **multiple players**, click the **DeviceID** button. This will generate a new wallet address based on the device ID and display it on the screen.
4. Make sure that this address has some **DOT tokens** (0.15 DOT is enough). You can transfer DOT using [polkadot.js.org](https://polkadot.js.org/apps).

After that, simply press **OK**, select an NFT skin, and start playing!

---

The client can be built for multiple platforms including **iOS**, **Android**, and **Desktop**, making it convenient for testing on any device.
